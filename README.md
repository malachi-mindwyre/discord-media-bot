# Discord Media Bot

## Bot Setup in Discord

2. Use `/setup #channel` to set your media channel
3. Use `/monitor add #channel` to start monitoring a channel
4. Media will automatically be copied to your designated media channel

**Note**: You only need to invite the bot once. Updates to the bot are automatically available without re-invitation, as long as the bot has the necessary permissions.

{
  "monitored_channels": {
    "guild_id": [channel_ids]
  },
  "media_channels": {
    "guild_id": channel_id
  },
  "monitor_all": {
    "guild_id": boolean
  },
  "include_author": {
    "guild_id": boolean
  }
}
```

## Permissions

## Recent Updates

- **Fixed duplicate posting issue**: Implemented advanced message tracking to ensure each piece of media is only copied once
- **Improved Twitter/X embed detection**: Added smart delay system that waits longer for Twitter/X embeds to fully load
- **Enhanced queue management**: Better handling of message processing to prevent race conditions
- **Camera reaction**: Bot now adds a ðŸ“¸ emoji reaction to all copied media messages
- **Consistent media ordering**: Media content now always appears before the source information for better visual consistency

## Troubleshooting

- **Twitter/X embeds not detected**: The bot now waits 8 seconds for Twitter/X embeds to load (vs 3 seconds for other media)
- **Bot not responding**: Check that the bot has proper permissions in both source and destination channels
